# Sprint 3 - DestPlanner

## Sprint Overview
**Duration:** Sprint 3  
**Focus:** New Features, Extended API, Unit Testing  
**Team:** Frontend (Angular) + Backend (Go)

---

## Work Completed in Sprint 3

### Backend

#### 1. **Destination Reviews & Ratings Feature**
- Users can submit a rating (1–5 stars) and written review for a destination
- Duplicate review prevention — one review per user per destination
- Users can edit and delete only their own reviews
- Get all reviews for a destination with average rating and total count
- Reviewer name included in response (first name + last name)
- Ownership validation — forbidden response when editing/deleting another user's review
- Added `reviews` database table

#### 2. **Destination Activities Feature**
- View all popular activities and attractions for a destination
- Add new activities to a destination
- Update existing activity details (name, description, category)
- Delete activities
- Friendly empty list response when no activities exist
- Destination existence validation on all endpoints
- Added `activities` database table

#### 3. **Trip Timeline View Feature**
- DB-backed itinerary items per trip stored in `itinerary_items` table
- Five activity types with colour-coding support: `travel`, `accommodation`, `activity`, `dining`, `other`
- `GET /api/trips/:id/timeline` returns all items grouped by day in chronological order (`date ASC`, `start_time ASC`, `sort_order ASC`)
- Each `TimelineDay` includes a `day_number` calculated relative to the trip's start date
- Create timeline items with automatic `sort_order` assignment per date
- Partial update — only fields sent in the body are changed
- Drag-and-drop reorder endpoint shifts sibling items to make room and moves the item to a new date and position
- Itinerary change notifications fired to group collaborators on item creation (goroutine, non-blocking)
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `trips` to `itinerary_items`
- Added `itinerary_items` database table

#### 4. **In-App Notifications Feature**
- DB-backed notifications stored in `notifications` table
- Seven notification types: `trip_reminder_7day`, `trip_reminder_1day`, `trip_updated`, `itinerary_changed`, `collaborator_added`, `expense_added`, `expense_settled`
- `GET /api/notifications` returns full history with `unread_count`; supports `?unread_only=true` filter
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` — lightweight badge-count endpoint designed for polling
- Mark single notification as read (`PUT /api/notifications/:id/read`)
- Mark all notifications as read in one call (`PUT /api/notifications/read-all`)
- Delete individual notifications from history (`DELETE /api/notifications/:id`)
- Per-user notification preferences stored in `notification_preferences` table — five independent toggles: `email_enabled`, `trip_reminders`, `itinerary_changes`, `expense_updates`, `collaborator_updates`
- `GET /api/notifications/preferences` and `PUT /api/notifications/preferences` — partial update, only sent fields change
- `POST /api/notifications/reminders/check` — checks for trips departing in exactly 7 or 1 day and creates reminder notifications; designed to be called by a cron job
- Notifications respect user preferences before inserting — disabled types produce no row
- `upsert` logic on preferences (INSERT OR REPLACE) — idempotent
- Internal `CreateNotification` helper silently no-ops on DB error so notification failures never block the triggering operation
- Notifications auto-fired from trip handler (create/update), group handler (member added, expense added), and timeline handler (item created)
- Added `notifications` and `notification_preferences` database tables

#### 5. **Compare Destinations Feature**
- Users can compare 2 to 3 destinations side by side
- Returns name, country, budget, and description for each destination
- Validates minimum of 2 and maximum of 3 destination IDs
- Rejects duplicate IDs in the same comparison
- Rejects invalid (non-integer) IDs
- Returns 404 if any destination ID does not exist
