# DestPlanner
## Problem Statement
Modern travelers face significant challenges when planning trips, including:<br>
• **Fragmented tools and platforms** - Users must juggle multiple applications for destination
research, itinerary creation, booking management, and expense tracking.<br>
• **Information overload** - Diﬃculty in filtering and comparing destinations based on personal
preferences and budget constraints.<br>
• **Collaboration ineﬃciency** - Limited real-time coordination features for group travel
planning, leading to miscommunication and duplicate eﬀorts.<br>
• **Budget unpredictability** - Lack of integrated expense tracking and cost simulation tools
results in budget overruns. (average of 20-30% over planned budget)<br>
• **Time wastage** - Travelers spend an average of 8-12 hours researching and organizing a
single trip across disconnected platforms.<br>
• **Poor itinerary management** - No centralized system to manage bookings, activities, and
schedules in one place.<br>
• **Lack of personalization** - Generic recommendations that don't account for individual travel
styles, preferences, and constraints.<br>

This project aims to consolidate trip planning activities into a unified platform, reducing
complexity, improving collaboration, and enabling data-driven travel decisions while saving
time and preventing budget overruns.<br>

## Project Description
**DestPlanner**: Intelligent Collaborative Travel Planning Platform<br>

**Overview:**<br>
DestPlanner is a cloud-based web application that consolidates destination discovery, itinerary
management, expense tracking, and collaborative planning into a single, integrated platform.
Built with Angular for an intuitive frontend and Go for a scalable backend, the platform
leverages rules-based recommendation algorithms to deliver personalized travel experiences
while streamlining the entire planning workflow.<br>

**Key Features:**<br>
**For Individual Travelers:**<br>
• Personalized destination recommendations based on budget, interests, climate preferences,
and travel dates.<br>
• Interactive itinerary builder.<br>
• Real-time expense tracking and budget monitoring.<br>
• Simulated booking workflows for flights, accommodations, and activities.<br>
• Climate-based smart packing suggestions.<br>
• Save and compare multiple trip options.<br>
• Personal travel history and preferences dashboard.<br>

**For Group Travelers:**<br>
• Shared itinerary creation and real-time collaborative editing.<br>
• Group expense splitting and tracking.<br>
• Voting and polling features for destination and activity selection.<br>
• Activity notifications and updates for all group members.<br>
• Integrated chat/messaging for trip discussions.<br>

**Platform Features:**<br>
• User authentication and profile management.<br>
• Rules-based destination recommendation engine.<br>
• Curated destination database with detailed information (attractions, climate, costs, reviews.)<br>
• Interactive map integration for geographic visualization.<br>
• Budget simulation and cost estimation tools.<br>
• Document storage for tickets, reservations, and travel documents.<br>
• Export itineraries to PDF/calendar formats.<br>
• Admin dashboard for content management and user support.<br>

## Technology Stack<br>

**Frontend:**<br>
• Angular 17+ for building a dynamic, single-page application.<br>
• Angular Material for UI components.<br>
• Leaflet/Mapbox for interactive maps.<br>

**Backend:**<br>
• Go (Golang) for high-performance REST APIs.<br>
• Gorilla Mux or Gin framework for routing.<br>
• JWT authentication for secure user sessions.<br>
• PostgreSQL/MySQL for relational data storage.<br>
• Redis for caching and session management.<br>

**Additional Technologies:**<br>
• WebSocket for real-time collaboration features.<br>
• Cloud storage (AWS S3/Firebase) for document uploads.<br>
• Payment gateway integration (for future booking features).<br>
• Docker for containerization.<br>
• CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.<br>
• Third-party APIs for weather, maps, and destination data.<br>

## Project Goals<br>
1. **Simplify Planning:** Consolidate 5+ separate tools into one unified platform.<br>
2. **Save Time:** Reduce trip planning time by 50-60% through automation and integration.<br>
3. **Enable Collaboration:** Provide seamless real-time coordination for group travel.<br>
4. **Budget Control:** Help users stay within budget through accurate cost tracking and
simulation.<br>
5. **Personalization:** Deliver tailored recommendations that match user preferences.<br>
6. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide insights and analytics to help users make informed
choices.<br>

## Target Users<br>
• Individual leisure travelers seeking organized trip planning.<br>
• Groups of friends and families planning shared vacations.<br>
• Business travelers needing eﬃcient itinerary management.<br>
